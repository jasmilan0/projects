###### Goal of this project is it find weaknesses within your organization. After learning how to use different tools and documenting all the weaknesses, I will be adding other VMs, which will be Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Ubuntu, firewall, and a SIEM. Once everything is configured, it will be reported again.
###### -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Step 1: Download kali linux vdi and metasploitable

##### https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines
##### https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/

## Step 2: Once downloaded, configure the machines

##### 2.1) Create a new vm for kali

##### 2.2) For memory size, I did 2048 which is 2gb of ram

##### 2.3) For hard disk, select "use an existing virtual hard disk file" and then select the vdi after extracting the kali zip

##### 2.4) Hit Create

##### Do the same thing for the metasploitable vm but instead of 2048 memory size make it 512mb.

## Step 3: Configuring the network

##### 3.1) Open up terminal and type this command:
vboxmanage dhcpserver add --netname milanlab --ip 10.10.10.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0 --lowerip 10.10.10.2 --upperip 10.10.10.25 --enable
##### This creates the internal network for virtualbox that we will connect both of the VMs. Keep in mind, metasploitable vm will have no internet access. Creating this server will only allow you to access metasploitable through local IP.

##### 3.2) Open settings for Kali VM and select the network settings

##### 3.3) For adapter 1, attach it to NAT

#####      For adapter 2, attach it to internal network and enter whatever name you created, in this case it would be milanlab

##### 3.4) Save the settings and now open the settings for metasploitable VM and select the network settings. For adapter 1, we are going to select internal network and add the name "milanlab". We are NOT going to connect it to the NAT network because we don't want this vulnerable machine to be available online.

## Step 4: Testing

##### 4.1) Load both the Kali VM and the Metasploitable VM. Default user + pass for kali is kali. Default for metasploitable is msfadmin.

##### 4.2) In kali open terminal and type in
        ifconfig
        <img width="746" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 11 31 40 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58121854/194100763-3f5e49b9-d207-4d33-a6e7-7a6ccb74811d.png">
##### We can access both the web and the internal network.

##### 4.3) Type the same command in metasploitable
<img width="362" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 11 32 51 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58121854/194101018-6d3df9bb-6f3d-4117-ba6e-dbaa05e23b94.png">

##### 4.4) Now ping both devices from each vm using only the internal network IP

<img width="342" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 11 59 37 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58121854/194107047-fe248b12-185e-4650-832e-963a1e13a459.png">

##### Both were able to be pinged, which shows connectivity which means everything was setup properly.





###### Setup of the lab is complete as of now. As mentioned before, creation of the lab is to imitate a startup of an organization and looking for and documenting vulnerabilities within an orgnaziation. After I learn a few other topics regarding pentesting and finding weakpoints within an organization, I will be ending different VMs to imitate a secure workplace.
