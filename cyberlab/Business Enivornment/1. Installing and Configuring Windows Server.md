Before installing and configuring everything make sure you have the following downloaded:
a) Windows Server 2019
b) Windows 10 ISO
c) Ubuntu

## Step 1: Create a new machine

##### a) Name the OS as following

##### b) Give it 2 gigs of ram ( 2048mb)

##### c) Create a virtual hard disk now and select the VDI file type. Make the storage dynamically located. And give it about 50gb

##### d) In settings, under general/advanced, have the shared clipboard and drag 'n' drop bidirectional

##### e) If possible, set the processor to 2 cpus. This is under system/processor.

##### f) Under storage, select empty. Under Attributes, there should be a disc symbol. Select that and select your windows server ISO.

##### g) Now go to network. We are going to have three network cards. Adapter 1 is going to be attached to NAT. Enable adapter 2 and attach it to internal network. Give it a name of "Client". When we configure the server, all client devices will be under the client adapter and will be in a separate subnet.

##### h) Click ok.

## Step 2: Installing the server
 
##### a) Start the machine. Click next and then install now.

##### b) Select the second option with the desktop experience.

##### c) Select custom install and then the drive. Click next. It may take a while for download. Let it restart and don't press any keys.

##### d) Set the admin password to your desire. For this entire lab, we are going to use one password which will be "Cyberlab1"

##### e) Since I am using a MAC, to login to the server, select input/keyboard/ctrl-alt-del on the top

## Step 3: Install guest addition packeges for smooth transitions of the screen size and mouse. Once installed, restart the OS.

## Step 4: Rename the PC. Go to Settings/System/About. Here, I named it DC. Once changed, make sure to restart.

## Step 5: Configuring Network Adapters

##### a) Open settings/network & internet

##### b) Select change adapter options. There will be two options. The one that says network under one of the names is the NAT. Right click that adapter and rename it to "Internet". Rename the other one to "Client".

##### c) Right click the Client adapter and select properties/ Internet Protocol version 4. Apply the settings in the image below. This will act as a router for devices that are on the Client network.
