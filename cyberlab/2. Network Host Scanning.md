## Basics of networking protocols
##### One of the protocols used is TCP. It uses a three way handshake to establish a network connecttion. To start a TCP session, client sends the a SYN packet to the server. The server receives this and replies with SYN/ACK packets. The client complestes this conversation by sending an ACK packet back to the server
##### Another protocol is the UDP. It is a connectionless network connection. UDP does not guarantee a packet transmission, so there is no three-way handshake. UDP is used for performance based 
##### ICMP is used for testing network connectivity. Ping tool can help with this. Ping is used to test whether a host network is up and running. In the image below you can see ICMP packets being sent to a device with the IP 10.10.10.6. Packets are being sent and received.

##### In this image below, we are pinging an IP address 10.10.10.3. Since no device was set up in the lab with the IP address of 10.10.10.3, the results from the ping scan says "Destination Host Unreachable".

##### ARP maps IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses

## NMAP
##### To scan for live hosts use the following command
*nmap -sn [IP Address / Range]*
##### n is for NO and s is for scan. "-sn" option is a no port scan. It is similar to a Ping scan, however much different. It will send ICMP echo request and will not give up if ICMP is blocked. It will also send out a timestamp request. It will also send an ACK packet to port 80 and a SYN packet to port 443 and then an ARP Request.

## Looking for open ports (TCP)
##### To execute a port scan, use the -sS option. It stands for a SYN scan, some people also call it a Stealth scan. It basically sends a SYN request to the server and if a SYN/ACK request is received, it will show that the port is open. If SYN/ACK request is not received by the scan, the scan will show the port either closed or filtered, filtered meaning a firewall is protecting it.

## UDP Port scan
##### To execute a UDP scan, use the option -sU. UDP is slow because of its connectionless nature. To make it fast, you can use -T5 timing option or even -T2 so you can bypass the firewalls and such.

## Basics of NMAP Scans
##### Running Nmap with no options will cause the scan to do three things automatically, a) the speed will be T3, b) it will scan the top 1000 ports, and c) it will set the scan to be a SYN TCP scan. SO basically no need for adding the -sS, -T3, or --top-ports 1000. 
##### To target a specific port, use the *-p [port number]* option or to scan a list of ports use *-p [1-65535] or -p- [for all ports]*

## Service Version Scan
##### To do a service version scan, use the option -sV. Since we also know which ports are open, we are going to make the scan faster
*nmap -p 21,22,23,25,53,80 -sV 10.10.10.6*

## Operating System Fingerprinting
##### In order to check for different OS within a network, add the -O option. You can also add the -sV to help identify with the OS. I will be also adding a few known open ports just to make the scan fast.
*nmap -p 21,22,23,25,53,80 -sV -O 10.10.10.6*
