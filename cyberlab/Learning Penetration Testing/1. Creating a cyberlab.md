##### Goal of this project is it find weaknesses within your organization. After learning how to use different tools and documenting all the weaknesses. I will be creating a lab environment on MacOS using virtualbox. In this lab, there would be four different network adapters that will be in use, Bridged, PentestNet, HiddenNet, and RedTeamLab. Adapter Brdiged, PentestNet, and RedTeamLab will be used for kali. Kali would also consist of a docker repository for OWASP Juice Shop. OWASP Broken Web Applcications VM will be another VM and the iso file can be downloaded off of sourceforge. Other VMs will consist of Metasploiable 2, Metasploitable 3 ubuntu, Metasploitable 3 Windows 2008 server, Windows Server 2019, and two Windows 10 Enterprises VM (each for Bob-PC and Alice-PC). Metasploitable 2 will have the adapter PentestNet. Metasploitable 3 windows will have the adpaters PentestNet and HiddenNet. Metasploitable 3 ubuntu will have the adapter HiddenNet. WindowsServer 2019, and the two Windows 10 enterprise VMs will have the adpater RedTeamLab.

## The following are the configurations for PentestNet, HiddenNet, and RedTeamLab. They are commands and can be copied and executed on terminal.
vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=PentestNet --server-ip=172.30.1.1 --lower-ip=172.30.1.20 --upper-ip=172.30.1.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable

vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=HiddenNet --server-ip=10.11.12.1 --lower-ip=10.11.12.20 --upper-ip=10.11.12.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable

vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=RedTeamLab --server-ip=192.168.42.1 --lower-ip=192.168.42.20 --upper-ip=192.168.42.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable

## Metasploitable 3 ubuntu and windows using Vagrant
##### Downloading this on Mac was a pain in the neck. When running commands to create the VMs using terminal, it would create the VM, set everything up, however on terminal it would not create a SSH connection. When I typed "ctrl-c", it will close everything and just delete the VM that was created. One way around this was to set the entire machine and create a clone. Once the clone is created, you can type "ctrl-c" into terminal and close terminal. Run the clone, and it should work properly.

##### This entire lab will be followed using the book, "The Ultimate Kali Linux Book Second Edition" By Glen D.Singh
