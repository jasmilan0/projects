#### 2 types of Reconnaissance:
  Passive: Indirect Approach and does not engage the target
  Active: Directly engages the target
  
#### Footprinting 
Much information about the target is colleected
Main Objectives
  1. Collect network information (domain names, IP Addressing Scheme, and network protocols)
  2. Collect system information (user and group names, routing tables, and system names)
  3. Collect organization information (employee details, company directory, and location details)

#### Open Source Intelligence
Information can be collected from online platforms such as LinkedIn, FaceBook, etc. Pentesters usually create sock puppets, fake identities. This can include creating a fake name, fake profile, and using a proxy credit card. 

#### Anonymizing Traffic
Three common techniques to anonymize traffic
 1. VPNs
    a) make sure logs are not kept or user data is not kept
    b) make sure VPN is integrated with the application on the OS
    c) make sure DNS information is not being leaked
 3. Proxychains
    a) does not encrypt the traffic but does prevent real IP address from being revealed
 5. TOR
    a) allows anonymity, secures traffic, and allows access to dark web
